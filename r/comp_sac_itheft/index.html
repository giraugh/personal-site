                <h1>Why Identity Theft may occur</h1>
                <p>
                    <h3>Legal issues as a result of identity theft</h3> Identity theft is a federal crime in some places but not in Australia. Someone would be influenced into committing identity theft because legally as a felon there are things you cannot do such as voting, or they might want to start again free from debt and their criminal records.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <h3>Social reasons</h3> Socially thieves might see merit in leaving their unfulfilling lives and starting over, sometimes they could be intimidated by getting on dangerous people’s bad side and stealing someone’s identity for safety.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <h3>Environmental reasons</h3> People could live in a bad country and to immigrate to another, they might need to steal a more respectable person’s identity.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <h3>Ethical reasons</h3> Ethically someone might steal another’s identity if the owner dies and to keep their business open the thief would steal the identity to fulfill the deceased legacy.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <h3>Principals/laws/policies/rules applying to the issue</h3> Ethical principles Stealing someone’s identity and incurring debt is often considered a ‘dick move’.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <h3>Laws</h3> Stealing someone’s identity in America is punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. In Australia it is not illegal to assume someone else’s identity but there are other associated supplementary offences such as fraud.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <h3>Policies</h3> The identity theft prevention policy for Georgia institute of technology on the Red Flag Rule to protect their students is the following;

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <ol>
                        <li> Identify relevant Red Flags for new and existing covered accounts. and incorporate those Red Flags into the Program</li>
                        <li>Detect Red Flags that have been incorporated into the Program</li>
                        <li>Respond appropriately to any Red Flags that are detected in order to help prevent and mitigate Identity Theft</li>
                        <li>Ensure the Program is updated periodically to reflect changes in risks to students or to the safety and soundness of the Institute from Identity Theft.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br />

                    <h3>Actions taken against offenders</h3> In Australia it is not considered a federal offence for identity theft but if you use someone else's credentials with the intent to “commit, or facilitate the commission of a serious criminal offence” will be considered an offence under section 144B of the Criminal Law Consolidation act 1935 In America in 1998, Congress passed the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, this Act makes Identity Theft a federal offence, punishable by a $250,000 fine and up to 15 years in prison. Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (cth) s 24 makes it illegal to open an account in a false name. Migration Act 1958 (Cth) s 234 makes it illegal to have false papers etc while migrating.

                <h1>Information systems</h1> There are many information systems used in identity theft, and like with real theft there are many approaches to stealing from victims. Identity thieves may use a combination of both physical devices and software to steal data. Through the recent popularity rise of less secure transaction methods such as ‘Tap & Go’ and NFC, the ability to steal credit card credentials is easier than ever. One system used by attackers to steal credit card credentials is a card reading device. A card reading device uses near field chip (NFC) technology to copy a credit cards details which the attacker can then copy onto a ‘clone’ card and use it to make unauthorized transactions. Another system used by attackers is email. Attackers send official looking emails to victims t try and gain their credentials, which is known as phishing. There are many forms of phishing, including spear phishing for example which targets specific companies or individuals for a usually significantly bigger effect. Attackers also make use of packet intercepting software to spy on networks and intercept the transfer of sensitive data, for example to steal a user’s bank credentials. ‘Tap & Go’ is a technology that has risen in popularity throughout the last two years which allows users to make smaller transactions without the need for a PIN or other security. This increases the capacity for criminals to use these credentials without triggering security features.

                <h1>Stakeholders</h1>
                <p>
                    Identity theft affects many parties of people. One stakeholder in the issue is individuals or groups (such as businesses) who are victims of identity theft that may have suffered financial loss or negative credit reputation. The Australian Law Reform Commission identified credit reputation as an issue in their recommendation on the Use and Disclosure of Credit Recording Information where they considered the introduction of court-granted certificates to allow victims to prove that they are victims of identity theft in an attempt to rectify theircredit history . Another stakeholder in identity theft is the thief stealing the identity. The Identity Thief gains access to priv a te information that may be used for their own financial or social gains but may be caught and reprimanded. Identity theft t a federally recognised offence in australia but ther e aremany other provisionary offences that cover the area, relevant statutes include the Criminal Code (Cth), Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) and the Migration Act 1 (Cth). Financial Businesses are also affected as they try to cover the costs the victims have lost through the identity theft. This may affect other clients of the business as it is paid for through increased charges or interest rates. Financial Businesses also are also pushing Tap & Go and NFC technology which is somewhat fuelling identity theft.
