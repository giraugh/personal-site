        <h1>Analysis</h1>
        <p>
			The survey shows that over 30% of students are currently using insecure payment methods on a regular basis. Half of these participant&#39;s accounts were setup to allow upwards of $100 to be spent in a single transaction with no further identification needed. The ability to make large transactions with no identification allows thieves to quickly take large amounts of money out of their victims accounts before the alarm can be raised.
			Additionally, Although most of these participants identified that other nearby individuals or hidden cameras could monitor the input of their security credentials such as a PIN, most were unaware that security credentials could be stolen directly from the card through local data-transfer technology. 
			These results illustrate a major issue in our current anti-identity theft programs. The participants were largely ignorant of the growing, modern procedure used for the illegal acquisition of confidential information. Ignorant participants are likely to take no action to prevent these attacks and as such are vulnerable to Identity theft and other crimes.
			In response to these results it is suggested that banks and other financial institutions refrain from providing services such as ‘Paywave’ and ‘Tap & Go’ as users are not taking the necessary precautions and because these methods are insecure even when precautions are taken. In their current state these technologies are vulnerable to the whims of identity thieves worldwide.
